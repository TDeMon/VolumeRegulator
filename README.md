VolumeRegulator
===============

I have the simple old keyboard. And I'm using this app to control the sound of playing music without switching to the Player.

To use this app you should create a few shortcuts for this app (in current version count = 4).
Then for each shortcut add following parametrs respectively:
-up
-down
-mute
-internet
This parameters doing the folowing:
-increase the volume
-decrease the volume
-mute
-show/hide internet application.
For each shortcut you can assign fast-call buttons combination - and use it as on modern keyboards
or as on a laptop with 'Func' button .
